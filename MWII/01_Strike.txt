AL MAZRAH

The camera pans down to reveal a set of bootprints in the sand before cutting to a crevice in a rock formation.

Graves: (over radio) Gold Eagle Actual, Shadow-1 is weapons hot. We're burning daylight here...

Sunlight pours through the opening of the rock formation as a lone figure walks through the passageway.

Shepherd: (over radio) Copy, Graves. Stand by. Laswell, do we have confirmation?

Laswell: (over radio) Watcher-1 to Bravo 0-7, you in position?

The lone figure emerges from the passageway into the light, revealing himself to be Simon Riley AKA Ghost.

Ghost: Nearly there.

The camera switches to Ghost's POV and...
SIMON "GHOST" RILEY - TF-141, SHADOW CO.

STRIKE

AL-MAZRAH, U.R.A.

15 JULY 2022, 1600

The sound of a helicopter is heard.

Ghost: Got a heli incoming.

The helicopter passes over Ghost.

Laswell: That's General Ghorbrani.

Shepherd: Right on time. Now, get up there and let's see what he's up to in the middle o' nowhere.

(If Ghost takes his time getting up to the vantage point...)

Shepherd: Ghost, relay when the target is visual.

Ghost makes his way through the passage as he climbs up rocks and reaches an opening that overlooks the vast desert area.

Ghost: I'm eyes on.

Laswell: What do you see?

Ghost takes out his scope and spots an entire group of vehicles, soldiers, weapons, and equipment gathered together.

Ghost: Armed personnel, armor and hardware... All Russian.

Shepherd: What the hell are the Russians doin' with Ghorbrani?

Laswell: Supplying Iran. It's an arms deal.

Shepherd: You copying this, Shadow-1?

Graves: Affirmative- two birds, one stone...

Laswell: We need positive ID on Ghorbrani before we kick this off, boys.

Shepherd: Ghost, can you identify the General?

(If Ghost doesn't aim his scope at the enemy soldiers gathered down below...)

Shepherd: Ghost, get your glass in there and find the General.

Ghost looks through his scope and spots several soldiers gathered around a lone military officer.

Ghost: Armed escorts around one VIP. Russians are very happy to see him.

Shepherd: It'll be the last time they do...

The Russian soldiers escort the officer through the vehicles until the officer turns around, revealing himself to be
General Ghorbrani.

(If Ghost doesn't yet mark Ghorbrani...)

Laswell: Ghost, do you have positive ID on Ghorbrani?

Ghost: No joy, stand by.

Ghost marks Ghorbrani with his scope.

Ghost: Visual on General Ghorbrani.

Laswell: Copy. All stations- target confirmed.

Shepherd: Shadow-1- You are cleared hot for launch.

Graves: Roger that, Actual.

The scene changes to a truck with a cargo container on top.

Graves: Ghost, you are danger close to the zone. This arrow's gonna pack a punch.

Ghost: Copy. Approved. Send it.

The cargo container opens to reveal a missile launcher that arms and prepares to launch.

Graves: All stations, Shadow-1. Missile is ready for immediate delivery, stand by for launch.

The camera pans sideways to reveal Phillip Graves seated at the missile controls.

Graves: Coordinates in... Target designated... Two... One... Shot out.

The missile launches while several soldiers from Shadow Company stand guard outside.

Graves: Missile is loose.

The missiles flies over the desert and enters a low-lying canyon. The player must then guide the missile through the canyon
towards its intended destination.

Graves: Link is good, target acquired. This will take some manual guidance to hold her.

(If the missile starts to veer off course...)

Shepherd: Check your heading, Shadow-1...

(After the missile is guided back on course...)

Shepherd: Bearing is good, Shadow-1.

The missile progresses on its flight path.

Graves: Missile bearing northeast at 0-6-5 degrees at Mach 3... Altitude 500 meters.

Shepherd: You're right in the pocket, stay with it...

Graves: Check, coming' in hot... Brace for impact.

The missile engages its boost as it approaches its target.

Graves: Time to target 5 seconds... Termination in 3, 2, 1...

The missile hits the Russian convoy, producing a massive explosion in the area. The shockwave from the explosion passes by
Ghost, who remains unscathed.

Ghost: Bloody fucking hell. Direct... Target destroyed...

The screen cuts to black.

MODERN WARFARE II

================================================

__Plot__::
On July 15th, 2022, as part of a recon operation, Simon "Ghost" Riley is deployed in Al Mazrah, where he navigated through
a canyon to an open area, where he spotted the Russian Ground Forces doing an arms deal with General Ghorbrani of Iran's 
Quds Force, through the usage of the spotter scope. Ghost waited for the dust to move, then he marked the General. After 
receiving confirmation from Ghost, a ballistic missile is launched from a modified truck, which is controlled by Commander 
Phillip Graves of Shadow Company. Graves carefully guided the missile to its destination, hitting the site where the arms 
deal was happening, killing everybody, including Ghorbrani.
